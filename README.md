## Introduction
Sup 9 Martingale MT5 is an innovative forex trading solution designed to implement a Martingale strategy. The code provided here is a simplified version of the trading algorithm used in the robot. It includes necessary libraries, constants, variables, and functions for trading.

## Trading Algorithm
The main trading function in this code is the `trade()` function. It follows a Martingale strategy, where it initially places a buy order with a lot size defined by the constant `INITIAL_LOT_SIZE`. After each successful trade, the lot size is doubled. The function continues to place buy orders until the maximum number of orders defined by the constant `MAX_ORDERS` is reached.

## Function Descriptions
- `OnStart()`: This is the main function that is executed when the EA starts. It connects to the InrexEA DB system, loads machine learning algorithms, manages trading data, executes the trading algorithm, and closes all open orders.
- `connectToDB()`: This function is responsible for connecting to the InrexEA DB system. The code for this functionality is not provided in this sample.
- `loadMLAlgorithms()`: This function loads machine learning algorithms. The code for this functionality is not provided in this sample.
- `manageTradingData()`: This function is responsible for managing trading data. The code for this functionality is not provided in this sample.
- `closeAllOrders()`: This function closes all open orders. The code for this functionality is not provided in this sample.

## Usage
To use this code, you need to have the MetaTrader 5 platform installed. Simply copy the code into a new Expert Advisor (EA) file in MetaEditor, compile it, and attach it to a chart in the MetaTrader 5 platform. The EA will then execute the trading algorithm based on the defined strategy.
